{{site.description}}

Robin’s professional journey began with eight immersive internships at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. There, she tackled various aspects of human spaceflight from designing and testing avionics to developing the HOMER telemetry tool that enhanced Orion flight software development and operations for Artemis missions. Her work on RFID and FPGA systems and contributions to robotics software further sharpened her ability to deliver mission‑critical solutions under rigorous conditions.

As the Flight Software Lead for the R5 CubeSat Project, Robin designs and continually integrates flight software for R5’s current and future spacecrafts using her own cFS Glue and Unit‑Test Library (CGUL). This framework has streamlined the development of adaptable flight software across multiple missions. Building on that success, she’s integrating R5’s flight software into the HyperSTEP Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) vehicle to showcase advanced payload operations during EDL scenarios.

In her current role as Project Manager for the Chiron Exploration Electronic Health Record (xEHR) System, Robin oversees the entire design and development life-cycle of a health record solution for long-duration exploration missions. She has led her multidisciplinary team through a Software Requirements Review and orchestrated an integrated demo in a test bed that synchronized spacecraft and ground‑based versions of the software. Her strategic vision guides the project’s road-map, ensuring seamless integration with the Crew Health and Performance Integrated Data System Platform (CHP‑IDSP).

Known for her resilience, creative problem‑solving, and collaborative leadership style, Robin continues to pioneer next‑generation spacecraft software architectures. Whether advancing the R5 and HyperSTEP missions or supporting future human spaceflight initiatives, she remains devoted to turning bold ideas into reliable, real‑world systems.
